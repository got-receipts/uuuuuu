# GigOS

GigOS is a production-ready MVP for independent gig-worker shift tracking. It does **not** connect to Uber, DoorDash, Grubhub, Instacart, Amazon Flex, or any third-party gig platform API.

> GigOS is an independent shift, mileage, break, and earnings tracker for gig workers. Not affiliated with Uber, DoorDash, Grubhub, Instacart, Amazon Flex, or any delivery platform.

## Stack

- Flutter Web mobile-first PWA frontend
- FastAPI backend
- PostgreSQL
- SQLAlchemy + Alembic
- JWT authentication with bcrypt password hashing
- Docker Compose for local development
- Railway-compatible root Dockerfile

## Local Development

Copy the example environment file if you want local overrides:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Run the full stack:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Services:

- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend API: http://localhost:8000
- API docs: http://localhost:8000/docs
- PostgreSQL: localhost:5432
- Health: http://localhost:8000/health

The backend service runs `alembic upgrade head` automatically before starting.

## Railway Deployment

1. Create a Railway project.
2. Add a Railway PostgreSQL service.
3. Deploy this repository as a Dockerfile service. Railway detects the root `Dockerfile`.
4. Set these variables on the app service:

```text
DATABASE_URL=${{Postgres.DATABASE_URL}}
JWT_SECRET=<strong random secret>
JWT_ALGORITHM=HS256
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=10080
CORS_ORIGINS=https://your-railway-domain.up.railway.app
```

The root Dockerfile builds Flutter Web to `build/web`, copies it into the FastAPI image, runs migrations, and serves the PWA and API from the same Railway service. The healthcheck path is `/health`.

## iPhone PWA Install

This repo is currently set up for the fastest iPhone path: install the Railway-hosted Flutter Web app as a Safari PWA.

1. Deploy GigOS to Railway.
2. Open the Railway app URL in Safari on the iPhone.
3. Tap the Safari share button.
4. Tap **Add to Home Screen**.
5. Launch GigOS from the new home-screen icon.

The frontend includes a web manifest, Apple mobile web app tags, theme color, and app icons. Location features require HTTPS, which Railway provides on deployed services.

If you deploy frontend and backend as separate services later, build `frontend/Dockerfile` with:

```text
API_BASE_URL=https://your-backend-domain
```

## API Routes

- `POST /auth/register`
- `POST /auth/login`
- `GET /me`
- `POST /shifts/start`
- `POST /shifts`
- `PATCH /shifts/{id}/end`
- `PATCH /shifts/{id}`
- `GET /shifts`
- `GET /shifts/{id}`
- `DELETE /shifts/{id}`
- `POST /shifts/{id}/breaks/start`
- `PATCH /breaks/{id}/end`
- `GET /reports/weekly`
- `GET /export/csv`
- `GET /health`

## Calculation Rules

- `total_minutes = ended_at - started_at`
- `gross_hourly = gross_earnings / hours`
- `tax_set_aside = gross_earnings * 0.20`
- `maintenance_reserve = miles * 0.15`
- `net_profit = gross_earnings - gas_cost - other_expenses - tax_set_aside - maintenance_reserve`
- `net_hourly = net_profit / hours`
- `earnings_per_mile = gross_earnings / miles`

Break companion thresholds:

- Every 80 minutes: prompt for a geo-confirmed break
- 8 hours: fatigue warning

Location intelligence:

- `GET /locations/break-zones` uses public OpenStreetMap Overpass POI data to find nearby 24-hour fuel/convenience locations and other rest stops.
- `GET /locations/activity` estimates hot zones from public restaurant, cafe, convenience, supermarket, and retail POI density.
- These are open-data estimates, not Uber, DoorDash, Grubhub, Instacart, Amazon Flex, or delivery-platform order metrics.

## Security Notes

- Passwords are hashed with bcrypt.
- Access tokens are signed JWTs with expiration.
- GigOS never stores delivery platform passwords.
- GigOS performs no scraping.
- GigOS does not use third-party gig platform APIs.

## Tests

Run backend tests locally:

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pytest
```

Flutter checks:

```bash
cd frontend
flutter pub get
flutter analyze
flutter build web --release --dart-define=API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
```
